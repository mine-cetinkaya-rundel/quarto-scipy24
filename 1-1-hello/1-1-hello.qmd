# What is Quarto?

## Quarto ...

is an innovative, open-source scientific and technical publishing system compatible with Jupyter notebooks and all your favorite plain text markdown editors

![Artwork from "Hello, Quarto" keynote by Julia Lowndes and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, presented at RStudio Conference 2022. Illustrated by Allison Horst.](images/horst-quarto-schematic.png){fig-alt="A schematic representing the multi-language input (e.g. Python, R, Observable, Julia) and multi-format output (e.g. PDF, html, Word documents, and more) versatility of Quarto." fig-align="center"}

## With Quarto ...

you can **weave** together **narrative** and **code** to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more, with...

::: incremental
-   **consistent** implementation of attractive and handy features across outputs: tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc.
-   defaults that meet accessibility guidelines as well as features that enable good practices for producing **accessible** documents
-   native **multi-lingual** support for multiple languages like Python, R, Julia, Observable, and more via the Jupyter engine for executable code chunks

# How it works

## Revisit: What is Quarto? {.smaller}

Quarto is a command line interface (**CLI**) that renders plain text formats (`.qmd`, `.rmd`, `.md`) OR mixed formats (`.ipynb`/Jupyter notebook) into static PDF/Word/HTML reports, books, websites, presentations and more.

. . .

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|10|15|16"

## Under the hood

![](images/ipynb-how-it-works.png){fig-align="center"}

::: incremental
-   `jupyter` evaluates Python code and returns a `.md` file along with the evaluated code
-   Quarto applies Lua filters + CSS/LaTeX which is then evaluated alongside the `.md` file by Pandoc and converted to a final output format
:::

## Under the hood

with a wider lens...

![](images/quarto-how-it-works.png){fig-align="center"}

::: incremental
-   `jupyter` or `knitr` evaluates Python, Julia, R, or Observable code and returns a `.md` file along with the evaluated code
-   Quarto applies Lua filters + CSS/LaTeX which is then evaluated alongside the `.md` file by Pandoc and converted to a final output format
:::

## Aside: Lua filters {.smaller}

-   Here is an example of a Lua filter that converts strong emphasis to small caps, from <https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html>:

``` lua
return {
  {
    Strong = function (elem)
      return pandoc.SmallCaps(elem.c)
    end,
  }
}
```

. . .

-   Lua filters written by R/Python/Julia developers should be interchangeable between formats - not language specific!

. . .

-   We won't go into the details of writing Lua filters in this workshop, and you don't need to worry about learning about Lua filters unless you're working on extending Quarto.

## Your turn

::: your-turn
In VS Code, open the `hello-penquins.qmd` file. Render the document to HTML.

-   Add an `author` field in the YAML and add your name.

-   Add some text and style it with bold, italics, etc. using the source editor as well as the visual editor. 

-   Modify the figure to add units to the axis labels: **g**rams for body weight and **mm** (milimeters) for flipper length. Render or preview the document and make sure the changes are reflected in the HTML output.

-   Change the html theme to `sketchy`. See <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html> for documentation on HTML theming.
