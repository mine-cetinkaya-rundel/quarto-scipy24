  In books, you can cross-reference between pages (chapters), but (currently), you can't cross-reference between pages in websites\n:::\n\n\n## Our turn\n\n::: our-turn\nLet's build a website that features a few of the notebooks we worked on and highlight the following features of Quarto websites:\n\n-   Add a `_quarto.yml`\n-   Create a landing page: `index.qmd`\n-   Explore navigation options: `navbar`, `sidebar`\n-   Apply themes, including a light and dark theme toggle\n-   Publish to QuartoPub with `quarto publish`\n-   An aspect of the workshop webpage that you fancy?\n:::\n\n## Your turn\n\n::: your-turn\n-   Add one more notebook that has at least one executable code cell and add it to the navigation list in `_quarto.yml` and render your site.\n-   Add an [about page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html), `about.qmd`, personalize it, and add it to the navigation list in `_quarto.yml` and render your site.\n-   Re-publish on QuartoPub with `quarto publish`.\n:::\n\n\n{{< countdown minutes=10 >}}\n\n\n# Listings\n\n## Listings\n\n-   Listings enable you to automatically generate the contents of a page (or region of a page) from a list of Quarto documents or other custom data\n\n-   Useful for creating blogs, providing navigation for large numbers of documents, or any other scenario where you’d like the contents of a page to be automatically updated as documents are added, updated, and removed\n\n## Blogs\n\n::: our-turn\nLet's now add a blog component to our website:\n\n-   Move two of your notebook files into a new a folder called `posts`.\n-   Collect these notebooks in a new blog page using the [listings feature](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html).\n    -   Don't forget to make corresponding changes in your `_quarto.yml` file.\n-   Experiment with the style of listings and choose one you like.\n:::\n\n# Computations\n\n## When should code be re-run?\n\n::: incremental\n-   You might have a reason to re-run all code in a Quarto website (every single cell in every single document) every time you render the website.\n\n-   But, chances are, that's not what you want.\n\n    -   Just playing around styling -- you probably don't want to run the code again\n\n    -   Changed some code in a document -- you probably want to re-run the code in that document, but not necessarily others\n\n    -   Made a big change affecting computations on many or all pages -- you probably want to re-run all code\n\n-   `freeze` and `cache` options give you fine control over these decisions\n:::\n\n## Freeze\n\n-   The `freeze` option controls when/if computational documents be re-rendered during a global project render:\n\n``` yaml\nexecute:\n  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render\n```\n\n``` yaml\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes\n```\n\n``` yaml\nexecute:\n  freeze: false  # always re-render\n```\n\n-   The `freeze` option is typically added to a `_metadata.yml` file within a specific directory, affecting all files in that directory.\n\n-   For blogs, set `feeze` in `_metadata.yml` at the root of the `posts` directory.\n\n-   You can have it only within specific subdirectories for more complex sites.\n\n## Freeze and Jupyter notebooks\n\n-   When rendering an `.ipynb`, Quarto will not execute the cells within the notebook by default, assuming that you have already executed them while editing the notebook\n\n-   To execute the cells, pass the `--execute` flag to render:\n\n``` {.bash filename=\"Terminal\"}\nquarto render notebook.ipynb --execute\n```\n\n-   Or specify this behavior within the notebook’s YAML front matter:\n\n``` yaml\n---\nexecute:\n  enabled: true\n---\n```\n\n## Cache\n\n-   Cache stores the results of computations for a specific file\n\n-   Cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code (or other cache attributes you've defined)\n\n-   `cache` can also be set at the chunk level, particularly useful for computationally expensive chunks\n\n## Freeze vs. cache\n\n-   Freeze option is typically set\n\n    -   for the whole website in `_quarto.yml`, or\n\n    -   for files within a directory in `_metadata.yml` in that directory\n\n``` yaml\nexecute: \n  freeze: auto\n```\n\n-   Cache option is typically set for a given file or for individual chunk(s) in a file.\n\n``` yaml\nexecute:\n  cache: true\n```\n\nor\n\n::: {#b9e7bc45 .cell cache='true' execution_count=1}\n```` { .cell-code}\n```{{python}}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n````\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Publishing\n\n## QuartoPub\n\n-   [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) is a free publishing service for content created with Quarto. It is ideal for blogs, course or project websites, books, presentations, and personal hobby sites.\n\n-   Publish with `quarto publish`:\n\n``` {.bash filename=\"Terminal\"}\nquarto publish quarto-pub\n```\n\n-   Gain a `_publish.yml` that is safe to check into version control.\n\n## Other venues\n\n-   GitHub Pages\n-   Posit Connect\n-   Netlify\n-   [More venues](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/other.html)\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Learn more\n\n::: {.center-align .large}\n[quarto.org/docs/websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/>)\n:::\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://quarto.org/docs/websites\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" style=\"border:2px solid #123233;\" title=\"Quarto Websites\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n## Questions\n\n::: your-turn\nAny questions / anything you'd like to review before we wrap up this module?\n:::\n\n",
