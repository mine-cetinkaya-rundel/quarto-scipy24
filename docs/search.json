    "text": "Overview\nSharing knowledge through writing is a critical aspect of scientific activity, including data science. It allows researchers to communicate their findings and insights to a broader audience, build upon existing work, and collaborate with others in their field. Quarto, an innovative, open-source scientific and technical publishing system compatible with Jupyter Notebooks and plain text markdown documents, provides data scientists with a seamless way to publish their work in a high-quality format that is easily accessible, shareable, and reproducible. With Quarto, researchers and data professionals can turn their notebooks into professional-looking publications in various formats, including web pages, books, slides, dashboards, and scientific manuscripts. This workshop will demonstrate how Quarto enables data scientists to turn their work products into professional, high-quality publications.\nThe learning outcomes for the workshop include:\n\nAuthor documents in plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks with equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, and advanced layouts.\nLearn how to author content in IPython/Jupyter and the Quarto VS Code extension.\nLeverage Quarto for creating different types of publications, including webpages/blogs, slides, dashboards, books, websites, and scientific manuscripts.\nCustomize execution and content with a rich array of code cell options, filters, and extensions.\nHost websites and publications on platforms such as GitHub Pages, QuartoPub, and Netlify.",
