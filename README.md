## Abstract

Quarto is an innovative, open-source scientific and technical publishing system compatible with Jupyter Notebooks and plain text markdown documents. Quarto provides data scientists with a seamless way to publish their work in a high-quality format that is reproducible, accessible, and shareable. With Quarto, researchers can turn their Jupyter Notebooks and literate plain text markdown documents into professional-looking publications in various formats. This workshop will demonstrate how Quarto enables data scientists to turn their work products into professional, high-quality documents, slides, websites, scientific manuscripts, and other shareable artifacts.
